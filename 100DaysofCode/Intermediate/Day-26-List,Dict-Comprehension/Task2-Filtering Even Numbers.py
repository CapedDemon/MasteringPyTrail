Instructions
In this list comprehension exercise you will practice using list comprehension to filter out the even numbers from a series of numbers.

First, use list comprehension to convert the list_of_strings to a list of integers.

Then use list comprehension again to create a new list called result. This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers.

Again, try to use Python's List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

# TODO: Use list comprehension to filter out the odd numbers

result = [even for even in integer_list if even%2 == 0]
