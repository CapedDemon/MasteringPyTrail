    "This program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height and provides an interpretation of their BMI according to the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the BMI is under 18.5, they are considered **underweight**.\n",
    "- If the BMI is over 18.5 but below 25, they have a **normal weight**.\n",
    "- If the BMI is over 25 but below 30, they are **slightly overweight**.\n",
    "- If the BMI is over 30 but below 35, they are **obese**.\n",
    "- If the BMI is above 35, they are **clinically obese**.\n",
